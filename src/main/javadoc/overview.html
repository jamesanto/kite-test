<p>Kite is a Spring-based library of components helping you make your integrated systems more stable and performant. The
central concept is that of a <i>guard</i>, and guards are essentially wrappers around integration points that protect
both the service and the client. Guards protect services by blocking off client misbehavior (usually unintentional, but
sometimes malicious). For example, if a client is calling a service too often, then a rate-limiting guard can help with
that. Or if a service is having performance issues, sometimes clients respond by retrying over and over ("hammering").
This only makes the problem worse. You can put a circuit breaker in place to cut the hammering off.</p>

<p>On the client side, unresponsive services result in queuing, which propagates service availability and performance
issues to the client by depleting client resources (e.g., threads). Circuit breakers help clients too because they
return immediately when the service is unavailable.</p>

<h2>Using Kite</h2>

<p>Kite supports multiple models for adding guards to your app. These are generally aligned with common Spring Framework
approaches. The recommended way is to use annotations and namespace configuration. Here's how that looks:</p>

<h4>Step 1. Create your guards</h4>

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans ...&gt;
    &lt;kite:annotation-config /&gt;
    &lt;kite:circuit-breaker id="circuitBreaker" exceptionThreshold="3" timeout="30000" /&gt;
    &lt;kite:concurrency-throttle id="concurrencyThrottle" limit="50" /&gt;
    &lt;kite:rate-limiting-throttle id="rateLimiter" limit="5000" /&gt;
&lt;/beans&gt;</pre>

<h4>Step 2. Annotate your service</h4>

<pre><span>@</span>Service
<span>@</span>Transactional
public class MessageServiceImpl implements MessageService {

    <span>@</span>GuardedBy({ "concurrencyThrottle", "rateLimiter", "circuitBreaker" })
    public List&lt;Message&gt; getMessages() { ... }
}</pre>

<p>As you can see, there's very little fuss with this approach to using Kite.</p>

<p>Kite also supports AOP-based guarding via interceptors, and programmatic guarding via templates. In fact, the
namespace configuration is really just a wrapper around AOP interceptors, which in turn use templates. So the model
forms a coherent stack.</p>

<p>Finally, all guards are JMX MBeans, so you can manage them from a JMX console like JConsole or JVisualVM. You can
for example manually trip and reset circuit breakers in this fashion, or adjust concurrency and rate limits.</p>

<h2>Available guards</h2>

<p>Kite is a new library so there aren't many guards yet. The good news, though, that that the guards that actually
exist are broadly useful. More guards are on the way (e.g., a guard that limits requests to specific time windows)

<table>
	<tr>
		<th style="text-align:left">Guard</th>
		<th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Circuit breaker</td>
		<td>Rejects requests when the backend service is generating too many exceptions for whatever reason. This
		could be severe performance issues or outright unavailability. Helps the service get back on its feet if it's
		a performance issue, and helps the client avoid queuing.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Concurrency throttle</td>
		<td>Rejects requests when there are too many requests being serviced at once. This can be especially useful
		for resource-intensive requests.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rate limiter</td>
		<td>Prevents too many requests from a single client coming in during a given time window. Useful for
		implementing web services whose use you want to quota.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
